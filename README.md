### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have developed technical skills and am in continuous learning in Mobile and Web development, Frameworks, APIs, notions of Systems Architecture, Git and Github and agile methodologies.

I am always seeking knowledge day by day. I can quickly learn what is needed to keep the process going. I believe that we always need to learn, think outside the box and get out of the comfort zone.
